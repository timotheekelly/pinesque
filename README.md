The purpose of this project was to practice with React components such as React routing and use the sanity backend to quickly set up a backend.

React would be my the framework I use most often when creating web apps so any chance to play around with it is good and 
being able to use sanity should help improve efficiency of prototyping apps in the future as it is so easy to set up.

The authentification for this app is done with Google Authentification. This was my first time using it. it being so secure and easy to setup, I wanted to familiarise myself with the setup.
